            Some are thought to resemble deer antlers, trees, giant fans,
            brains, and honeycomb.
          </p>

          <p>
            Corals were around at the time of the dinosaurs - that's about 500
            million years ago! Some of the corals we see today have taken as
            much as 50 million years to form. This is one of the reasons we
            should worry when corals die, their population will not be recreated
            within a human lifetime.

          <p>
            Octopuses have decentralized brains and the majority of its neurons
            live in the arms. Those neurons assist the arms to independently
            touch, taste, and have their own basic motions giving the impression
            that octopus has nine brains.
          </p>

          <p>
            Octopuses can change their skin colors in the blink of an eye! The
            'chromatophores', special cells of the octopus, are the reason
            behind their amazing transformation. These special cells beneath
            their skin have thousands of colors

          <p>
            Fennec foxes have extraordinary hearing to locate underground prey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their thick fur helps to insulate them from the cold desert nights.
            Their sandy coloration helps to reflect heat, and also provides
            excellent camouflage. Fennec foxes also have thick fur on the soles
            of their feet, which insulate against the hot sand of the desert.
            This extra fur on the soles of their feet also afford them excellent
            traction in the loose sand.
